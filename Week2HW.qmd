# Scenario: You are a data scientist for the LA Lakers!

![2009 NBA Champion LA Lakers](lakers.jpg){fig-alt="Picture of the 2008-2009 Season LA Lakers team"}

For this week's coding exercise we are going to pretend that you are a data scientist working for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2009 off-season. You are coming out of a championship win last season and team manager, Mitch Kupchak, and coach, Phil Jackson, are looking for insights into how they can win another one next season. They come to you asking to do an analysis using data from last season to help them figure out where they should focus their efforts to improve the team. In this case, instead of having a question and finding data to address that question, we are given a data set and are then tasked with asking what questions can we ask with these data?

For the sake of this tutorial, I am going to tell you that the questions we are going to ask are as follows:

1.  Which players committed the most turnovers?

2.  Which players missed the most free throws?

3.  Last season, the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers won more games during regular season than the Lakers. Which Lakers players performed the best against these teams in terms of attempted shots? Rebounds? Assists?

## Getting started

First things first, we load our data set and take a look at it. I am only going to show you some of the ways you can explore this data set, then provide you with a written summary. In reality, you would spend a lot of time taking a look at each column and familiarizing yourself with what the data entail.

MAKE SURE TO RUN ALL CODE CHUNKS.

```{webr-r}
#create an object "lakers" that includes our data set
lakers <- lubridate::lakers 

```

NOTE: the lubridate package (an R add-on) has this data set pre-loaded in it, which is why the above code works. We are using the assignment arrow "\<-" to create an object "lakers" that is the lubridate lakers data set.

```{webr-r}
#the glimpse function allows us to take a quick look at the data/data structure
glimpse(lakers)
```

NOTE: It's a good idea to make note of what form the data takes in each column. In this case, all columns are character strings <chr> or integers <int>. This is important because we might not want them to take that form. For example, the "date" column is currently an integer, but if we were to work with it, we might want it to be recognized as an actual date. We will spend more time working on dealing with issues like this later in the semester.

```{webr-r}
#the head function prints the first six rows of the data
head(lakers)
```

```{webr-r}
#we can look at the unique values for specific columns using the unique function and the $ operator
unique(lakers$etype) #the type of plays recorded
```

NOTE: the "\$" operator allows us to select a column within a dataframe. In the above code chunk, we used the unique() function on the etype column by typing lakers\$etype. The line of code says look in the lakers dataframe for the etype column and give us a list of the unique values present in that column.

We see that our data includes game logs from the entire season with the following variables (variables we will be actively using in this tutorial are bolded):

-   date: Date of the game

-   **opponent: Three letter code for the opponent team the Lakers played against**

-   game_type: Whether the game was home or away

-   time: The time on the game clock when the play was recorded (i.e. time left in the quarter)

-   period: Quarter of the game (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), with 5 representing overtime

-   **etype: Type of play recorded**

-   **team: The team that made the play**

-   **player: The player that made the play**

-   **result: The result of the play - blank for non-shots, "missed" or "made" for shots**

-   points: Number of points the play resulted in

-   type: Type of play - type of foul for fouls, type of shot for shots, type of rebound for rebounds

-   x: The location along the x plane (court width) of the play (shots only)

-   y: The location along the y plane (court length) of the play (shots only)

## Question 1: Who committed the most turnovers?

For this first question, I will walk you through how to find the answer, showing you some important data wrangling tools along the way. We will spend A LOT more time exploring these tools in future weeks, so don't worry too much if you don't follow all the code.

-   Which players committed the most turnovers?

To answer this, we first need to do some data filtering. We are only interested in plays made by the Lakers, so we need to filter the data to only include "LAL" observations in the "team" column.

```{webr-r}
#filter the data so we only have plays made by the Lakers
lakersQ1 <- lakers %>%  
  filter(team == "LAL") 

#check to see if that worked
unique(lakersQ1$team) #should only print "LAL"
```

In the above code chunk, I introduced a new coding operator, the pipe, denoted by "%\>%" or "\|\>". You can imagine this translating to "and then". We are creating a new object called lakersQ1. To create this object we take the lakers data "and then" we filter it so that the "team" column only includes "LAL". We use == when filtering (not =). NOTE: we are using the dplyr package filter() function, not the base R filter() function.

Now that we have done that, we need to determine which players committed the most turnovers by keeping only observations associated with turnovers. We can again accomplish this using filtering.

```{webr-r}
#only pull data related to turnovers
lakersQ1 <- lakersQ1 %>% 
  filter(etype == "turnover") 

#take a look at the first 6 rows to see if we only have turnovers
head(lakersQ1)
```

NOTE: when we use the assignment arrow (\<-) with the same object name as the one we made previously ("lakersQ1"), we are overwriting our original lakersQ1 object and creating a new one.

Now we can create a visualization to see who committed the most turnovers. Again, we will be spending a lot more time working through how to make visualizations, so don't worry too much about the code. Focus more on interpreting the output.

```{webr-r}
ggplot(lakersQ1, aes(x = player)) + #create a plot with player as the x axis
  geom_bar() + #plot a bar plot
  theme_bw() + #add a theme
  labs(x = "Player", y = "Turnover Count") + #change the axis labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) #adjust the x axis labels so we can read the player names
```

We see that Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, and Lamar Odom committed the most turnovers across the season. Assuming you know nothing about basketball, I will tell you that these are three of the biggest stars on this championship team. This means they probably got waayyyy more playing time than the other players, giving them more opportunity to commit a turnover in the first place. This is an important lesson for multiple reasons:

1.  You should always evaluate your results to see if they make sense in the context of the bigger picture. Kobe Bryant is one of the greatest NBA players of all time and played with the Lakers his entire 20 year career. If we were using this as a metric for deciding who gets traded, we probably haven't found a very good metric. But then again, even Kobe has room for improvement... 200 seems like a lot, and he could use this information to focus his efforts on reducing turnovers.

2.  Sometimes folks you are working with think they want the answer to one question (who committed the most turnovers?), but what they really want is the answer to a different question (who committed the most turnovers accounting for how often they played?).

*What's something we could do to make this a fairer picture of turnover rates?*

```{webr-r}
#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT

```

## Question 2: Which players missed the most free throws?

Let's move on to the second question.

-   Which players missed the most free throws?

First thing we have to do is again pull only data related to observations of plays commited by the Lakers (not their opponents).

Adjust the following code chunk so that you create an object called "lakersQ2" that filters for only plays made by the Lakers. (HINT: Look back at how we tackled this task in the first question.)

```{webr-r}
#filter so we only have observations of Laker plays
lakersQ2 <- lakers %>% 
  filter([FILL ME IN]) #REPLACE [FILL ME IN] WITH YOUR RESPONSE

#check that worked
unique([FILL ME IN]) #REPLACE [FILL ME IN] WITH YOUR RESPONSE
```

Now we need to filter so we only have data associated with free throws.

Adjust the following code to accomplish that task. (HINT: Look at how we filtered to only have observations of turnovers in the first question.)

```{webr-r}
#filter so we only have observations of free throws
lakersQ2 <- lakersQ2 %>% #use the object you just created and overwrite it
  filter([FILL ME IN]) #REPLACE [FILL ME IN] WITH YOUR RESPONSE

#take a look at your new data
head(lakersQ2)
```

Finally, we also need to filter so we are only looking at *missed* free throws.

Adjust the code chunk below to do the final filtering so we are looking at data on free throws missed by the Lakers.

```{webr-r}
#filter so we only have observations of MISSED free throws
lakersQ2 <- lakersQ2 %>% #use the object you just created and overwrite it
  filter([FILL ME IN]) #REPLACE [FILL ME IN] WITH YOUR RESPONSE

#take a look at your new data
head(lakersQ2)
```

Assuming you completed the three code chunks above correctly, this following code chunk should generate a bar plot of the number of missed free throws for each player.

*Take a screenshot of the resulting plot and include it in your homework response.*

```{webr-r}
#TAKE A SCREEN SHOT OF THIS PLOT AND INLCUDE IT IN YOUR HW SUBMISSION
ggplot(lakersQ2, aes(x = player)) + #create a ggplot with the lakersQ2 data with player as the x axis
  geom_bar() + #plot a bar plot
  theme_bw() + #add a theme
  labs(x = "Player", y = "Missed Free Throw Count") + #change the x and y axis labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) #adjust the x axis labels so we can read the player names

```

*Which players missed the most free throws?* *Is there anything you would change about this question/analysis to get a fairer picture of free throw percentages?*

```{webr-r}
#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT
```

## Question 3: Who performed highest against the best opposing teams?

Moving on to our final question!

-   Last season, the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers had higher W/L percentages than the Lakers. Which players performed the best against these teams in terms of attempted shots? Rebounds? Assists?

We will again rely on filtering to find the answer.

First, let's filter so the data only include games played against the Celtics and the Cavs. I'll do this one for you, just make sure to run the code chunk below.

```{webr-r}
#filter so we only have games against the Cavs or Celtics
lakersQ3 <- lakers %>% 
  filter(opponent == "CLE" | opponent == "BOS") 
```

In the above chunk, I used the "\|" operator. When filtering, this symbol, \|, means "or". In the second line of code we are saying we only want observations where the opponent column is "CLE" (for the Cavs) OR "BOS" (for the Celtics). We will learn more about these types of operators later in the semester.

Now that we have only the games we are interested in, let's filter so we only have observations of plays made by the Lakers. *Fill out the code chunk below to accomplish that task.*

```{webr-r}
#filter so we only have plays made by the Lakers
lakersQ3 <- lakersQ3 %>% 
  filter([FILL ME IN]) #REPLACE [FILL ME IN] WITH YOUR RESPONSE

#type code that will let you see if you were successful

```

Let's start with who had the most attempted shots?

*Use the code chunk below to filter for shots in the etype column. Call the new object lakersQ3_shots.*

```{webr-r}
#WRITE/RUN THE FULL CODE HERE TO FILTER FOR ONLY SHOTS IN THE ETYPE COLUMN
lakersQ3_shots <- 
```

Assuming you completed the code chunk above correctly, the following chunk should generate a plot telling you who took the most shots against the Celtics and Cavs last season.

*Take a screenshot of the resulting plot and include it in your HW response.*

```{webr-r}
#TAKE A SCREEN SHOT OF THIS PLOT AND INLCUDE IT IN YOUR HW SUBMISSION
ggplot(lakersQ3_shots, aes(x = player)) +
  geom_bar() + #plot a bar plot
  theme_bw() + #add a theme
  labs(x = "Player", y = "Shot Count") + #change the x and y axis labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) #adjust the x axis labels so we can read the player names

```

Now let's do the same thing to see who had the most rebounds.

*Use the code chunk below to filter for rebounds in the etype column from the lakersQ3 object. Call the new object lakersQ3_rbs.*

```{webr-r}
#WRITE/RUN THE FULL CODE HERE TO FILTER FOR ONLY REBOUNDS IN THE ETYPE COLUMN
```

Assuming you completed the code chunk above correctly, the following chunk should generate a plot telling you who got the most rebounds against the Celtics and Cavs last season.

*Take a screenshot of the resulting plot and include it in your HW response.*

```{webr-r}
#TAKE A SCREEN SHOT OF THIS PLOT AND INLCUDE IT IN YOUR HW SUBMISSION 
ggplot(lakersQ3_rbs, aes(x = player)) + 
  geom_bar() + #plot a bar plot   
  theme_bw() + #add a theme   
  labs(x = "Player", y = "Rebound Count") + #change the x and y axis labels   
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) #adjust the x axis labels so we can read the player names 
```

Now, can we accomplish the same task for assists?

*Use the code chunk below to filter for assists in the etype column.*

(HINT: you might want to take a look at the available options in the etype column using the unique() function, similar to what we did in the "Getting started" section.

```{webr-r}
#WRITE/RUN THE FULL CODE HERE TO FILTER FOR ONLY ASSISTS IN THE ETYPE COLUMN
#OR EXPLAIN WHY YOU CAN'T DO THAT AND SCREENSHOT...
```

## Concluding remarks

Obviously, I intentionally made this is a very simplified example, as we are just starting to get our feet wet in terms of coding in R, but these types of analyses actually go on behind the scenes for most sports teams.

*Based on our very limited analysis what would your recommendations be to the Lakers coach and manager regarding what to focus on for next season?*

```{webr-r}
#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT

```

There are much more complicated questions we could ask and analyses we could perform with these data as well. We stuck with questions directly related to the variables present, but we can also take these data another step using data manipulation and analysis tools. Even though the active court lineup is not provided, we could deduce which players were on the court at certain times and ask something like which lineup led to the most points scored? Or which lineup led to the most missed shots by the other team? We could also try predicting outcomes using these data. What is the probability of the Lakers winning a game given the number of minutes Kobe Bryant plays in the first half? How about given the number of consecutive away games they've played?

*What is another more complex question you could answer using these data?*

```{webr-r}
#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT

```

As we move through this semester, we will try to build your coding skills so that you can start trying to address these types of more complex data science questions on your own. We might even revisit this data set later in the semester to see if we can implement the tools you've learned to ask more complex questions.
