All material and concepts should be attributed to the Data Science in a Box initiative.\n\n## The problem of plastic\n\nPlastic pollution is a major and growing problem, negatively affecting oceans and wildlife health. [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution) has a lot of great data at various levels including globally, per country, and over time. For this lab we focus on data from 2010.\n\nAdditionally, National Geographic ran a data visualization communication contest on plastic waste as seen [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/funding-opportunities/innovation-challenges/plastic/dataviz/).\n\n![](images/plastic.jpg){width=\"836\"}\n\n*Image: Mahamed Abdulraheem - Shutterstock.com*\n\n## Plastic data\n\nThe code chunk below sets up our coding environment. You will see I use the library() function to call packages. Packages are add ons you can load into R that include specialized functions. By typing library(tidyverse) we are asking R to load all of the tidyverse packages, including ggplot2. We are also going to load in our global plastic waste data set from a .csv file stored on my computer using the read_csv() function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) \n\nlibrary(tidyverse) #this call loads all tidyverse packages (including ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n```{webr-r}\n#load our data\nplastic_waste <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kmblincow/UVIDataScience1_F24/main/data/plastic-waste.csv\")\n```\n\nThat data set we have loaded has the following variable descriptions:\n\n-   `code`: 3 Letter country code\n\n-   `entity`: Country name\n\n-   `continent`: Continent name\n\n-   `year`: Year\n\n-   `gdp_per_cap`: GDP per capita constant 2011 international \\$, rate\n\n-   `plastic_waste_per_cap`: Amount of plastic waste per capita in kg/day\n\n-   `mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap`: Amount of mismanaged plastic waste per capita in kg/day\n\n-   `mismanaged_plastic_waste`: Tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste\n\n-   `coastal_pop`: Number of individuals living on/near coast\n\n-   `total_pop`: Total population according to Gapminder\n\nWhat are some ways you can explore the data set we just loaded in the R environment? Type a couple things in the chunk below and screenshot the resulting code/output for your HW assignment.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#ADD CODE HERE AND SCREENSHOT CODE/OUTPUT\n```\n\n## Exercises\n\nLet's start by looking at the distribution of plastic waste per capita in 2010.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Week4HW_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne country stands out as an unusual observation at the top of the distribution. One way of identifying this country is to filter the data for countries where plastic waste per capita is greater than 3.5 kg/person.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplastic_waste %>% \n  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  code              entity     continent year gdp_per_cap plastic_waste_per_cap\n1  TTO Trinidad and Tobago North America 2010    31260.91                   3.6\n  mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap mismanaged_plastic_waste coastal_pop\n1                             0.19                    94066     1358433\n  total_pop\n1   1341465\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDid you expect this result? You might consider doing some research on Trinidad and Tobago to see why plastic waste per capita is so high there, or whether this is a data error.\n\n-   Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita faceted by continent. (HINT: You might want to revisit the Mine's video from last week ;) )\n\n```{webr-r}\n#ADD CODE HERE AND SCREENSHOT CODE/OUTPUT\n```\n\n-   What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita?\n\n```{webr-r}\n#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT\n```\n\nAnother way of visualizing numerical data is using density plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Week4HW_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd compare distributions across continents by colouring density curves by continent.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Week4HW_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting plot may be a little difficult to read, so let’s also fill the curves in with colours as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent, \n                     fill = continent)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Week4HW_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe overlapping colours make it difficult to tell what’s happening with the distributions in continents plotted first, and hence covered by continents plotted over them. We can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this. The `alpha` argument takes values between 0 and 1: 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. There is no way to tell what value will work best, so you just need to try a few.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent, \n                     fill = continent)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Week4HW_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis still doesn’t look great…\n\n-   Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#ADD CODE HERE AND SCREENSHOT CODE/OUTPUT\n```\n\n-   Describe why we defined the `color` and `fill` of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot but we defined the `alpha` level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT\n```\n\nAnd yet another way to visualize this relationship is using side-by-side box plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = plastic_waste, \n       mapping = aes(x = continent, \n                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Week4HW_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to [violin plots](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html).\n\n```{webr-r}\n#ADD CODE HERE AND SCREENSHOT CODE/OUTPUT\n```\n\n-   What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?\n\n```{webr-r}\n#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT\n```\n\n## Do it on your own\n\n```         \n**Remember:** We use `geom_point()` to make scatterplots\n```\n\n-   Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita using a scatterplot. \n\n```{webr-r}\n#ADD CODE HERE AND SCREENSHOT CODE/OUTPUT\n```\n\n-   Describe the relationship.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT\n```\n\n-   Color the points in the scatterplot by continent.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#ADD CODE HERE AND SCREENSHOT CODE/OUTPUT\n```\n\n-   Does there seem to be any clear distinctions between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated?\n\n```{webr-r}\n#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT\n```\n\n-   Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and total population as well as plastic waste per capita and coastal population. You will need to make two separate plots.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#ADD CODE HERE AND SCREENSHOT CODE/OUTPUT\n```\n\n-   Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated?\n\n```{webr-r}\n#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT\n```\n\n-   Recreate the plot pictured below. (HINT: The x-axis is a calculated variable. One country with plastic waste per capita over 3kg/day has been filtered out. And the data are not only represented with points on the plot but also a smooth curve. The \"smooth\" should help you [pick which geom to use](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html).)\n\n![](images/RecreatePlot.png)\n\n```{webr-r}\n#ADD CODE HERE AND SCREENSHOT CODE/OUTPUT\n```\n\n-   Write an interpretation of what you see in context of the data.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#WRITE YOUR ANSWER TO THE ABOVE QUESTION HERE AND SCREENSHOT\n```\n",
